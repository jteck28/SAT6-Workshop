== OpenSCAP Overview

Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a specification for expressing and manipulating security data in 
standardized ways. SCAP uses several individual specifications in concert to automate continuous monitoring, 
vulnerability management, and security policy compliance evaluation reporting.

SCAP is a list of specifications maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for maintaining 
system security for enterprise systems.

OpenSCAP is an implementation (application) of SCAP specifications on Linux.
